  title: 'Technology Today: A Paucity of Integrity and Imagination'
  type: talk
  hashtags: Ethics
  abstract: Judging by the experiences of Robert Grimm and a close confidante, both
    academe and industry have long given up even trying to conduct their business
    in an ethical fashion. In this talk, the author will detail some of the most egregious
    instances of deeply unethical if not outright criminal behavior across their career,
    will argue that they are representative of elites acting in a deeply irresponsible
    and self-serving manner, causally tie that misbehavior to the rise of nativist
    nationalism across the western world, and contrast it all against the civilization-ending
    threat of climate change. This talk sounds the alarm as much as it identifies
    our last best hope for survival. It’s up to us!

    bio: Robert Grimm has two degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from MIT
      and the University of Washington, served as Associate Professor at NYU, received
      a National Science Foundation CAREER award, and was selected for a junior fellowship
      at NYU’s Center for Teaching Excellence. He also worked as a member of the team
      maintaining Goldman Sachs’s mission-critical trade and risk management platform.
      But none of these qualifications and accomplishments are as relevant to technology
      today as his mother’s schooling on the history of the Shoah, him somehow surviving
      the years of the plague, and, more recently, coming within days of ending his
      life.

  abstract: Dataflow programs are networks of connected nodes representing operations
    on the data that flows through them. Array programs support powerful, parallelizable
    operations on fixed-size data. Dataflow and array languages have been around for
    many decades, but relegated to niche engineering fields. Covering a new part of
    the 2nd edition of the speaker's book "Exercises in Programming Style", this talk
    revisits old ideas in the context of the brave new world of deep learning.

  title: Quantitative Types in Idris 2
  type: talk
  hashtags: Idris
  abstract: Dependent types allow us to express precisely *what* a function is intended
    to do.  Recent work on Quantitative Type Theory (QTT) extends dependent type systems
    with *linearity*, also allowing precision in expressing *when* a function can
    run. This is promising, because it suggests the ability to design and reason about
    resource usage protocols, such as we might find in distributed and concurrent
    programming, where the state of a communication channel changes throughout program
    execution.  Up to now, however, there has not been a full-scale programming language
    with which to experiment with these ideas.  Idris 2 is a new version of the dependently
    typed language Idris, with a new core language based on QTT, supporting linear
    and dependent types. In this talk I will show the benfits of QTT in Idris 2, in
    particular how it improves interactive program development by reducing the search
    space for type-driven program synthesis; and, how resource tracking in the type
    system leads to type-safe concurrent programming with session types.

  title: Miniaturize All States!
  type: talk
  hashtags: Haskell
  abstract: 'Like science, software is in reproducibility crisis. All too often, "steps
    to reproduce" in bug reports don''t work or are too long and complicated. They
    shouldn''t be necessary to begin with. Fleets of servers suffer from constant
    "configuration drift", making any incremental change to their state hazardous.
    Will an upgrade that worked yesterday work today? Will it work for you if it worked
    for me? We''re never quite sure. Lack of reproducibility hinders sharing, from
    lab reports to bug reports to build instructions to software packages to cloud
    infrastructure. The solution: miniaturizing the inputs to your lab experiment
    and to your build bots, the state of your laptop and of your resources in the
    cloud, using precise, shareable, composable declarative specifications.'

  title: Reliable Stack Traces, the Reality of Myth
  type: talk
  hashtags:
  - DWARF
  - Performance
  abstract: Debug information is a hidden and obscure component of our computing infrastructure
    obviously used by debuggers, but also playing a key role in program analysis tools,
    and, most surprisingly, in the runtime of programming languages. For instance
    C++ leverages DWARF stack unwind tables to implement exceptions!  Alas, generating
    debug information adds significant burden to compilers, and the debug info itself
    can be pervaded by subtle bugs, making the whole infrastructure unreliable.  Additionally,
    interpreting the debug tables is a bottleneck. My talk focuses on the DWARF unwind
    table, that enables stack unwinding in absence of frame-pointer information.  I
    show two techniques to perform validation and synthesis of unwinding tables, and
    their implementation for x86_64. Our validator has proven effective for compiler
    and inline assembly testing, while the synthesis tool can generate unwind tables
    for arbitrary binaries lacking debug information.  Additionally, I will report
    on a technique to precompile unwind tables into native x86_64 code, which we have
    implemented and integrated into libunwind, resulting in a 25x DWARF-based unwind
    speedup.

  title: 'Raku: Glue as Language'
  type: talk
  hashtags: Raku
  abstract: Let's review key features and implementation challenges of Raku, a modern,
    multi-paradigm language developed by the Perl community. Perl found success in
    its ability to glue disparate things together, a role it plays to this day. Perl
    also attracted criticism - some deserved, some overplayed. Raku shares values
    with Perl, but - in response to lessons learned and a changing industry - realizes
    them differently. The language brings tasteful trade-offs between dynamic and
    static, a new regex syntax, integrated grammars for tackling parsing far beyond
    what regexes can do, a grapheme level Unicode representation, "await" without
    "async", first-class syntax for reactive stream processing, the opportunity to
    participate in compile time - and more. A common refrain during the design process
    was to "torture the language implementor for the sake of the language user". The
    challenges this approach created - both solved and still being solved - will be
    explored along with the language features.

  type: talk
  hashtags: ProbabilisticProgramming
  abstract: f(x) = y, but y = 5. What's the probability that x =1? Probabilistic programming
    is the idea of describing probabilistic models as programs, to then automatically
    infer how our beliefs about model parameters change given observed data. In recent
    years, probabilistic programming languages (such as Stan) have demonstrated the
    power of this approach by becoming the underlying tool behind numerous projects
    in social science, biology, genetics, astrophysics, and engineering. But why haven't
    such languages been more widely adopted yet? In this talk, Maria will talk about
    the nuts and bolts of probabilistic programming languages, addressing the challenges
    behind making these languages general-purpose, automatic, and efficient.
