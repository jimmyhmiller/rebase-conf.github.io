title: Call for Presentations | Rebase Conf 2020
---
After five successful years, we have decided to broaden the scope of the event co-located with ECOOP and to join forces with another major academic conference, namely SPLASH, to create Rebase — a spin off of CurryOn.  We started with Rebase:Athens in 2019, and will hold Rebase:Berlin in July and Rebase:Chicago in October.

As before Rebase is a conference for practitioners interested in cutting edge technologies ranging from functional programming all the way to data science. Rebase will have three categories of talks:

- Master classes:  lectures on programming with functions, objects & data frames
- Edgy rants: discussions on technology, arts, ethics, education and mental health...
- Time capsules: talks on computing history 

We will also organize topical huddles to network and meet up. The location is the Scandic Potsdamer Platz Hotel in Berlin. The dates are July 15 - 17th 2020.
